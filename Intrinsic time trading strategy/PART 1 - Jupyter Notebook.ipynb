    "## 4.3 Trading Strategy with Dynamic Stop-Loss and Take-Profit  \n",
    "\n",
    "This trading strategy is essentially **Trading Strategy 1**, but with the addition of the **Dynamic Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Strategy**. This means that both the stop-loss and take-profit levels adapt dynamically based on the current price movement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works  \n",
    "Once a position is opened with an initial stop-loss and take-profit, these levels are adjusted as the price moves in the expected direction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **For a Long Position**  \n",
    "- Every time the **current bid price** increases to:  \n",
    "  $$ (1 - \\text{coef} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{threshold factor}) \\times TP_{\\text{long}} $$  \n",
    "  The stop-loss and take-profit are updated as follows:  \n",
    "  - **Stop-Loss**:  \n",
    "    $$ SL_{\\text{long}} = \\text{current ask} \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{19}{20} \\times \\text{coef} \\times \\theta \\right) $$  \n",
    "  - **Take-Profit**:  \n",
    "    $$ TP_{\\text{long}} = \\text{current ask} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{20} \\times \\text{coef} \\times \\theta \\right) $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **For a Short Position**  \n",
    "- Every time the **current ask price** drops below:  \n",
    "  $$ (1 + \\text{coef} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\theta) \\times TP_{\\text{short}} $$  \n",
    "  the take-profit and stop-loss are adjusted as follows:  \n",
    "  - **Take-Profit**:  \n",
    "    $$ TP_{\\text{short}} = \\text{current bid} \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{20} \\times \\text{coef} \\times \\theta \\right) $$  \n",

    "    $$ SL_{\\text{short}} = \\text{current bid} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{19}{20} \\times \\text{coef} \\times \\theta \\right) $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that as the price moves favorably, the **stop-loss follows** to lock in profits, while the **take-profit extends** to capture larger potential gains.\n",

    "# 5. Identifying the First Directional Change  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the **first directional change** is slightly more complex than identifying subsequent ones. This is because we must track both the **moving maximum** and **moving minimum** to determine whether the initial directional change is **upward** or **downward** from the current state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, once the **first directional change** is identified, subsequent directional changes follow a **predictable alternating pattern**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the **previous directional change** was **downward to upward**, then the next step is to find the **maximum** after the **directional change (DC) point**.  \n",
    "- This maximum determines the next **DC**, which marks the transition from an **upward movement to a downward movement**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By continuously alternating between tracking **local maxima** and **local minima**, we can systematically identify each directional change in the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **threshold** $ \\theta $ is set to a **0.1% price change** to define a significant directional change in the **AUD/USD** currency pair.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Rationale Behind This Choice**  \n",
    "- **Market Sensitivity**: In forex trading, small fluctuations in price are common. A 0.1% change represents a meaningful move that is less likely to be just noise but still frequent enough to capture genuine market trends.  \n",
    "- **AUD/USD Volatility**: The AUD/USD pair is known for its moderate volatility. A 0.1% threshold is **large enough to indicate a shift in market sentiment** but **small enough to detect directional changes early**, allowing for timely trade execution.  \n",
    "- **Balance Between Responsiveness and Stability**: Setting $ \\theta$ too low could lead to frequent false signals (whipsawing), while a higher value might delay reactions to real trend shifts. A 0.1% threshold strikes a balance between **avoiding unnecessary trades** and **capturing genuine price reversals**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This threshold ensures that our strategy identifies **significant directional changes** while filtering out **minor price fluctuations** that do not meaningfully impact trading decisions.  \n"

    "# 10. Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some limitations in the current strategy that could be addressed for better results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Position Limitation**: The strategy only allows for one long and one short position at a time. Lifting this restriction might lead to better profits, as it would enable multiple positions of the same type to be open simultaneously, offering more trading opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fixed Position Size**: Each position is currently opened with a fixed size of one unit. Allowing the strategy to determine the position size based on various factors and market conditions could improve profitability and risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Varying Theta (ATV)**: The threshold factor, θ, is currently constant. Introducing an Adaptive Threshold Volatility (ATV) would allow θ to adjust based on the recent volatility and variability of the market data, enabling the strategy to respond more dynamically to changing market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Volume Weighted Extremes**: The detection of local extremes, as of now, solely depends on the price. This could be improved by also checking what volume has been traded at that extreme. A larger volume at an extreme could be indicative of an important point in comparison to an extreme with a lower traded volume. You can use weighted volume extremes to confirm directional changes (DC) in your trading strategy. When a price moves significantly (up or down), you check if the volume at that point exceeds a predefined threshold. This helps to ensure that the price move is supported by significant market activity.\n"
